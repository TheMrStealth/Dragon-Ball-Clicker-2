            If you don't know who I am, I am a person who loves to create games and make YouTube videos. So far all of my games are on Scratch, but I will be starting to code the games on a faster and more free platform. Currently, my goal is to get to 100 subscribers. Please go help me out and subscribe. Most of the games I've made are on scratch but I am starting to make them just by coding. I think it will be a big improvement and will speed up loading times.
