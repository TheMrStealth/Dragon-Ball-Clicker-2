            My YT channel is mainly focused on Fortnite but I will be streaming other games such as Minecraft survival, Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2, and occasionally Rocket League. I will let viewers join my in-game. Please help me get to 100 subscribers. This is one of my dreams and I really hope to accomplish it. Normally, I will be uploading weekly videos, such as montages, or streaming once or twice on a weekend. If I don't, the I am either grounded or I just didn't have the time. I will be posting on my Discord regularly and will be notifying everyone if I go live or upload a video.
